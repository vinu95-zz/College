    <h1>About Department</h1>
      <p class="mt-5">Department of Computer Science & Engineering came into existence with the establishment of institution East West Institute of Technology (EWIT) in the year 2001, affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), Belgaum, Karnataka and approved by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi. The aim of the department is in pursuit of academic excellence and better understanding, both in theoretical as well as practical aspect of the development of the concept, from fundamental level to its applications to meet the need of the society and government in this innovative, still rapidly changing field of the new millennium.</p>
        
        <p>The programmes currently offered by the Department are Bachelor of Engineering (B.E. – four years) , Master of Technology (M.Tech. – two years) and Research Ph.D / M.Sc (Engg) are purely research based with active participation of faculties and industry experts.</p>
        
        <p>The passion for teaching by well qualified and dedicated faculty members drives the department in nurturing the students to excellence. Faculty members are also actively involved in research and interests in covering broad range of Computer Science & Engineering: mainly theoretical in the areas of Computer Networks, Data Base Management Systems, Operating Systems, Compiler Design, Software Engineering. The faculty members together have published several research articles with high impact factor in leading global journals and in conferences. Faculty members constantly enrich their knowledge by innovative teaching methods, research and participating actively in seminars, conferences and workshops at national and international level.</p>
        
         <p> Department has well equipped laboratories to offer good practical knowledge as per the academic requirements and has a separate library with good collection of useful books. Special attention is given to the weak students through counselling and discussion by faculty members. Students actively participate in Forum activities conducted by Department of Computer Science & Engineering like programming competition, paper presentation. An eminent panel of judges are invited which in turn help students to gain more knowledge by their impressive talks.</p>
        
        <p>We have also brought out student resources to motivate and help students in academics. The student resource material consists of thoroughly prepared Printed Notes, Question Bank with solutions, Assignment Booklet, Lab Manual, detailed explanation of principle behind each experiment and Demonstration videos of all the experiments. In addition to this to make the theory classes more interesting by using PowerPoint presentations for which we have collected lots of Interactive learning software’s, Java applets, Animations and Interesting respective subject videos.</p>
        
         <p>After completion of 12 years service into molding the life of new generation to this much demanded branch of learning, now we are proud enough as our former students are core contributors in the industry in India and abroad in technology as well as research areas and are happy to stand firmly to support for coming generations.</p>
